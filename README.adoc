= Workspaces

This is a Fulcro 3 Port of https://github.com/nubank/workspaces. It is written
*in* Fulcro 3 so that Fulcro 2 is not on the classpath (which prevents
mistakes). It will *not* work with Fulcro 2. Use `nubank/workspaces` if you're using Fulcro 2.

= Note

You must add a recent enough version of `react-grid-layout` to the package.json of your main project if you are using
shadow-cljs, otherwise it will install an outdated one that doesn't work with react 19.

```
"react-grid-layout": "^1.5.2"
```
